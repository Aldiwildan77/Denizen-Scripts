# Scratchpad

Stuff I come up with on lunch breaks.

## Skills and spells

### Counter-attacks

* `on entity damaged by`
* * `<context.cause>` == `entity_attack`
* * `<context.damager>`

* Skill: Tie to off-hand items?
* Counter-attack spells?

### Attunement spells

* Mana is easy. What about redstone?
* Probably requires Denizen knowing what the costs of the spells are
  * Could do this via manually making a list in Denizen or maybe just wait for MagicSpells 4.0

### "Elite" spells

* If an Elite spell is on cooldown, no other Elite spell may be cast
