Denizen-Scripts
===============

A collection of scripts I use with the Denizen plugin on my server.

Some scripts of note:

* [Super energy system](https://github.com/SXRWahrheit/Denizen-Scripts/blob/master/players/SuperHandler.yml)
* [Socket handler](https://github.com/SXRWahrheit/Denizen-Scripts/blob/master/players/sockets/SocketHandler.yml)
* [Champion mob spawn handler](https://github.com/SXRWahrheit/Denizen-Scripts/blob/master/mobs/ChampionHandler.yml)
* [Anti-farm script](https://github.com/SXRWahrheit/Denizen-Scripts/blob/master/mobs/antifarm-yaml.yml)
* [Daily login rewards](https://github.com/SXRWahrheit/Denizen-Scripts/blob/master/utilities/LoginRewards.yml)
* [Reminders](https://github.com/SXRWahrheit/Denizen-Scripts/blob/master/utilities/Reminders.yml)

If you have any questions about their use, you can find me as Wahrheit on the Denizen Discord. Many can be easily adapted to another server with the right setup.

Please consider visiting us at mc.summaxr.com - we have a lovely little community and would be glad to have you join us.

Below are some YouTube videos demonstrating the use of various scripts.
