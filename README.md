Denizen-Scripts
===============

A collection of scripts I use with the Denizen plugin on my server. These files are provided as-is, with no warranty whatsoever.

If you appreciate me maintaining this repo, please consider [backing me on Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/summacrossroads) These files are designed for the Summa Crossroads Minecraft server, and if I'm unable to keep running it, I will stop maintaining the files and developing new ones.

Attribution can be a link back to this page with credit to me for designing the original works.

Some scripts of note:

* [Super energy system](https://github.com/SXRWahrheit/Denizen-Scripts/blob/master/scripts/players/SuperHandler.yml)
* [Socket handler](https://github.com/SXRWahrheit/Denizen-Scripts/blob/master/scripts/players/sockets/SocketHandler.yml)
* [Champion mob spawn handler](https://github.com/SXRWahrheit/Denizen-Scripts/blob/master/scripts/mobs/ChampionHandler.yml)

* [Reminders](https://github.com/SXRWahrheit/Denizen-Scripts/blob/master/scripts/utilities/Reminders.yml)

If you have any questions about their use, you can find me as Wahrheit on the Denizen Discord. Many can be easily adapted to another server with the right setup.
