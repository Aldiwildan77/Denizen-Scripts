Denizen-Scripts
===============

A collection of scripts I use with the Denizen plugin on my server.

If you have any questions about their use, you can find me as Wahrheit on Esper, Quake, and Freenode. Many can be easily adapted to another server with the right setup.

Please consider visiting us at mc.summaxr.com - we have a lovely little community and would be glad to have you join us.

Below are some YouTube videos demonstrating the use of various scripts.
